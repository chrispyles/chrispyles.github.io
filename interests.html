			<br>

			<p>While watching the Data 8 lectures as a part of my position at <a href="#ETSmodal">ETS</a>, I became intrigued by the prospect of data science; I thought that it was amazing how powerful computations could be processed in seconds and how the analysis of large data sets could be performed so quickly. It was in watching these lectures and doing some experiments with the <span class="code-box">datascience</span> module in my free time that I became enamoured with the prospect of learning coding beyond the simple aspects of <span class="code-box">datascience</span> and NumPy. I decided to enroll in <a href="#data8modal">Data 8</a> for Summer 2018 so that I could get credit for the practice I put in while at ETS, and then I moved to <a href="#cs88modal">CS 88</a>.</p>

			<p>In the course of my application for Two Six Capital, I completed their data challenge. This project involved analyzing a data set of transactions from one of their businesses in order to answer a few questions about how the business changed over the period from 2013 to mid-2016:</p>

				<ul><li>Is the business improving or deteriorating?</li>
					<li>Are there regional differences in the business?</li>
					<li>Is there seasonality in customer behavior?</li>
					<li>Is customer quality getting better or worse over time?</li></ul>

			<p>In answering these questions, I ran A/B tests to determine whether or not region played a role in the volume of transactions, and I analyzed how trends in gross revenue were indicative of the business's deterioration. For a detailed report and the code I wrote for this project, visit the project's page <a href="https://github.com/chrispyles/two-six-capital-challenge" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.</p>

			<p>In my own free time, I used what I learned between sitting in on Data 8 lectures during my work at <a href="#ETSmodal">ETS</a> and some work I did in CS 88 to write a Sudoku object that can open a file with a sudoku puzzle, read it, and determine if it is a valid solution, among other things. The full .py file can be found <a href="https://github.com/chrispyles/python-projects/blob/master/sudoku/sudoku.py" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>, but I have included the function that checks the validity of the solved puzzle blow.</p>

					<p>The first few lines of code import the UC Berkeley <span class="code-box">datascience</span> module and the module NumPy to work with arrays. The function prints a line that tells you whether or not your table is a solution, but it also returns the array <span class="code-box">collection_array</span>, which I used while writing the program in order to determine where the faults lay in the iterations (the <span class="code-box">for</span> loops).</p>


			
			<br>
			
			<p>Over the summer that I took Data 8, I worked on practice problems from past iterations of the CS 61A course (a course at UC Berkeley equivalent to Data 8 and CS 88), and I met GitHub and its webhosting platform, which inspired me to take up learning HTML and CSS on <a href="https://codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>. In a day, I had learned the basics of both languages and had this website up and running. (If you're interested, you can find the reposity for this website on <a href="https://github.com/chrispyles/chrispyles.github.io/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.) Coding, although a relatively new interest of mine, is something that I intend to learn as much as possible about, and which I intend to pursue throughout my life.</p>

			<br>
			<br>

			<h2>Finance and the Economy</h2>
			<p>This interest began when I took AP Macroeconomics in high school, and it has grown since. I was fascinated by how different sectors of the economy were so interconnected with each other, and how a small cause somewhere inevitable meant a large effect in a completely different place. Since AP Macro, my interest has grown more specifically into finance; this semester, I am taking <a href="#e120modal">E 120</a>, a class on economics and finance, and I hope to get more involved in UC Berkeley's finance community.</p>

			<br>
			<br>

			<h2>Data Science</h2>
			<p>At the end of Data 8, I found myself interested in learning more about data science. I decided to learn R, a data-oriented programming language, since it was used in most data science applications, and I also took the knowledge from Data 8 to begin working on other data sets that I could find online. As an example, for <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices" target="_blank">this data set</a> from Kaggle which has information about avocado prices, I built a <span class="eqn">k</span>-nearest neighbors classifier to classify avocados as either <span class="code-box">'conventional'</span> or <span class="code-box">'organic'</span>. <a href="./files/avocado_classifier.py" target="_blank">This .py file</a> (which requires the <span class="code-box">datascience</span> and <span class="code-box">numpy</span> Python modules and their dependencies, as well as the Kaggle dataset, to be downloaded in order to run) contains the code for the classifier; it classifies a set of avocados based on the average price, total volume, and total number of bags for that set. The <span class="code-box">test_accuracy</span> function defined in the file showed that the 7-nearest neighbors classifier was 95.6% accurate. You can also find the Jupyter Notebook (in HTML format) that I used while building the classifier and optimizing <span class="eqn">k</span> in the <a href="https://jupyter.cpyles.com" target="_blank">Jupyter</a> section of this website.</p>

			<br>

			<p>Another recent project of mine has been based on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance" target="_blank">an insurance data set</a> I found on Kaggle. It contains some information about different insurance customers, including age, sex, BMI, number of children, region, charges, and whether or not the person was a smoker. In <a href="https://jupyter.cpyles.com/insurance.html">this python notebook</a>, I first tried to see if there was a correlation between BMI and insurance charges; the value of <span class="eqn">r</span> that I computed was low enough that there might have been a slight correlation, but there certainly wasn't a prevalent one. Next, I decided to test whether or not being a smoker affected what you were charged by insurance companies; to do this, I did an A/B test to see whether or not the distributions of charges for smokers and non-smokers came from the same underlying distribution. I got a p-value of 0 (meaning that the observed value was more extreme that any of the simulated values under the assumption of the null hypothesis), and concluded that being a smoker does affect your insurance charges.</p>

				<p>I worked at ETS during the Spring 2018 semester, operating the booth in the back of one of the large lecture halls (which mainly involved projection, sound, lighting, and camera work). As a part of this, I would listen to lectures for classes without actually being enrolled in them. One of the classes I worked during, Data 8, sparked my interest and led to my taking the class during the subsequent summer term.</p>
