			<h2>Coding</h2> 

			<p>Languages: Python, HTML5, CSS, SQL, UNIX Command Line, Git | Currently Learning: JavaScript, R</p>

			<br>

			<p>While watching the Data 8 lectures as a part of my position at <a href="#ETSmodal">ETS</a>, I became intrigued by the prospect of data science; I thought that it was amazing how powerful computations could be processed in seconds and how the analysis of large data sets could be performed so quickly. It was in watching these lectures and doing some experiments with the <code>datascience</code> module in my free time that I became enamoured with the prospect of learning coding beyond the simple aspects of <code>datascience</code> and NumPy. I decided to enroll in <a href="#data8modal">Data 8</a> for Summer 2018 so that I could get credit for the practice I put in while at ETS, and then I moved to <a href="#cs88modal">CS 88</a>.</p>

			<br>

			<!-- originally on education page-->

			<p>In my own free time, I used what I learned between sitting in on Data 8 lectures during my work at <a href="#ETSmodal">ETS</a> and some studying I did for CS 88 to write a Python function that takes in a table with a filled in sudoku puzzle and determines whether or not the puzzle is solved correctly. Here is the program:</p>

					<p>The first few lines of code import the UC Berkeley <code>datascience</code> module and the module NumPy to work with arrays. The function prints a line that tells you whether or not your table is a solution, but it also returns the array <code>collection_array</code>, which I used while writing the program in order to determine where the faults lay in the iterations (the <code>for</code> loops).</p>


			
			<br>
			
			<p>Over the summer that I took Data 8, I worked on practice problems from past iterations of the CS 61A course (a course at UC Berkeley equivalent to Data 8 and CS 88), and I met GitHub and its webhosting platform, which inspired me to take up learning HTML and CSS on <a href="https://codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>. In a day, I had learned the basics of both languages and had this website up and running. (If you're interested, you can find the reposity for this website on <a href="https://github.com/chrispyles/chrispyles.github.io/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.) Coding, although a relatively new interest of mine, is something that I intend to learn as much as possible about, and which I intend to pursue throughout my life.</p>

			<h2>Finance and the Economy</h2>
			<p>This interest began when I took AP Macroeconomics in high school, and it has grown since. I was fascinated by how different sectors of the economy were so interconnected with each other, and how a small cause somewhere inevitable meant a large effect in a completely different place. Since AP Macro, my interest has grown more specifically into finance; this semester, I am taking E 120, a class on economics and finance, and I hope to get more involved in UC Berkeley's finance community.</p>

			<br>
			<br>

			<h2>Data Science</h2>
			<p>At the end of Data 8, I found myself interested in learning more about data science. I decided to learn R, a data-oriented programming language, since it was used in most data science applications, and I also took the knowledge from Data 8 to begin working on other data sets that I could find online. As an example, for <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices" target="_blank">this data set</a> from Kaggle which has information about avocado prices, I built a <span class="eqn">k</span>-nearest neighbors classifier to classify avocados as either <code>'conventional'</code> or <code>'organic'</code>. <a href="./files/avocado_classifier.py" target="_blank">This .py file</a> (which requires the <code>datascience</code> and <code>numpy</code> Python modules and their dependencies, as well as the Kaggle dataset, to be downloaded in order to run) contains the code for the classifier; it classifies a set of avocados based on the average price, total volume, and total number of bags for that set. The <code>test_accuracy</code> function defined in the file showed that the 7-nearest neighbors classifier was 95.6% accurate. You can also find the Jupyter Notebook (in HTML format) that I used while building the classifier and optimizing <span class="eqn">k</span> in the <a href="./jupyter_subpages/index.html" target="_blank">Jupyter</a> section of this website.</p>

			<br>

			<p>Another recent project of mine has been based on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance" target="_blank">an insurance data set</a> I found on Kaggle. It contains some information about different insurance customers, including age, sex, BMI, number of children, region, charges, and whether or not the person was a smoker. In <a href="./jupyter_subpages/notebooks/insurance.html">this python notebook</a>, I first tried to see if there was a correlation between BMI and insurance charges; the value of <span class="eqn">r</span> that I computed was low enough that there might have been a slight correlation, but there certainly wasn't a prevalent one. Next, I decided to test whether or not being a smoker affected what you were charged by insurance companies; to do this, I did an A/B test to see whether or not the distributions of charges for smokers and non-smokers came from the same underlying distribution. I got a p-value of 0 (meaning that the observed value was more extreme that any of the simulated values under the assumption of the null hypothesis), and concluded that being a smoker does affect your insurance charges.</p>

				<br>
				
				<p>I worked at ETS during the Spring 2018 semester, operating the booth in the back of one of the large lecture halls (which mainly involved projection, sound, lighting, and camera work). As a part of this, I would listen to lectures for classes without actually being enrolled in them. One of the classes I worked during, Data 8, sparked my interest and led to my taking the class during the subsequent summer term.</p>

				<p>Summer 2018: This course, whose full name is "Foundations of Data Science", is the first data science course students take at UC Berkeley. It covers the basics of Python, statistical models, hypothesis testing, A/B testing, p-values, and classification, among other things. More information on this course can be found at <a href="https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/stat/" target="_blank">https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/stat/</a> under the <strong>STAT C8</strong> heading.</p>

				<p>Fall 2018: This course is a connector to Data 8, and I took it in order to suplement the information that is normally taught in CS 61A (this is the first computer science course most UC Berkeley students take; Data 8 + CS 88 = CS 61A). More information on this course can be found at <a href="https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/compsci/" target="_blank">https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/compsci/</a> under the <strong>COMPSCI 88</strong> heading.</p>
