            <p class="lead">I am currently in my second year at UC Berkeley, pursuing a Data Science BA. Since tutoring for my high school CSF chapter, I have had a passion for teaching others, which has blossomed into taking a position on campus at the budding Division of Data Sciences. I started as a connector assistant (think lab assistant + curriculum development), and am now working on the External Pedagogy Team which interfaces with other institutions about how we teach data science. I am an Eagle Scout, and the dedication that allowed me to achieve that rank has also allowed me to hold down a job to help put myself through college and to work hard enough in high school that I will graduate college in only 3 years.</p>

            <p>I am currently attending UC Berkeley to earn my BA in Data Science, with an anticipated graduation of Spring 2020. I am also trying to take classes that are relevant to my interest in financial systems and computer science while working on campus and being active in extra-curriculars. When I came to UC Berkeley, I had intended to major in Chemical Biology; that quickly changed, however, as I realized just how much math interested me and I had the opportunity to begin learning data science.</p>

            <p>Some of the projects that I have completed in the course of my studies include Gitlet (a functional miniature-version of Git programmed in Java), BearMaps (a mapping and navigation program based on OpenStreetMaps), and a Spam/Ham classifier based on logistic regression with 5-fold cross-validation.</p>

            <h4>Data Science Curriculum Development, UC Berkeley</h4>

            <p>As a part of my time at the Division of Data Sciences at UC Berkeley, I participated in curriculum development for some courses that are taught by Division staff and for other “data-enabled” courses (courses outside the Division but which use Division infrastructure). The first course that I worked on, L&S 88, focused on reproducibility and open science. It was a connector course for Data 8 (the foundational course for data science students) and it was my role as a connector assistant that spurred me into working more and more at the Division.</p>

            <p>I present here some of the materials that I developed for courses at UC Berkeley as a part of the work I did at the Division, as well as some details on the courses they are for and my role therein. Most of what I present here is work relating to curriculum development, but I also worked as something of a lab assistant on courses, including L&S 88.</p>

            <h5><a href="https://d8a-88.github.io/econ-fa19" target="_blank">Data 88: Economic Models</a></h4>

            <p><strong>Fall 2019.</strong> This course is another Data 8 connector course that looks at how to apply the methods and tools of data science to economic questions. Lecture topics include SymPy, supply & demand, utility, the Cobb-Douglas production function, inequality, and other applied topics. I am a connector assistant for this class, and my contribution was the economic demography lecture along with some ipywidgets-backed applets for use in other notebooks.</p>

            <h5><a href="https://github.com/chrispyles/uc-berkeley/tree/master/ls88-sp19" target="_blank">L&S 88: Reproducibility and Open Science</a></h4>

            <p><strong>Spring 2019.</strong> This course was a Data 8 connector course that focused on questions of reproducibility and open science within the Data Science community. It featured lectures on things like Project Jupyter, Licensing, and Data Repositories & Archiving. My role in this class was as a connector assistant, which primarily involved curriculum development and lab assisting in class. I developed quite a few labs for this course, including a <code>matplotlib</code> tutorial and a lab on Python vs. R in Jupyter notebooks.</p>

            <p>I started at DDS in January 2019 as a connector assistant for L&S 88: Reproducibility & Open Science. This class teaches data science students about the culture in data science and the importance of reproducibility in results. The class covers technical topics ranging from Jupyter Notebooks to Markdown & LaTeX to Git. As connector assistant, my role was twofold: I attended class and acted as a lab assistant during the lab portion of the class, and I worked with the course instructors (Eric Van Dusen & Joshua Quan) to develop assignments that fit with the narrative they had for the course. The materials that I worked on for this course can be found <a href="https://github.com/chrispyles/uc-berkeley" target="_blank">on Github</a>.</p>

            <p>My internship at the division is a kind of hodgepodge of different responsibilities and projects. The position is focused around the External Pedagogy Team which interacts with other institutions to think about how we teach data science and grow the community since it is such an emergent field in higher learning. Because of my other connections at the division, however, I am also doing lots of other work, including working on another connector course, working on the website, and helping to put together a textbook of <a href="https://ds-modules.github.io/modules-textbook" target="_blank">featured modules</a> using Jupyter Books.</p>

            <p>As a student assistant, customer service skills are at the crux of my responsibilities. I interact with all of the students who need assistance from the Student Services team, and so I need to effectively work with others, and be able to help alleviate the concerns of others, give information regarding different aspects of summer courses, and perform basic office tasks. I am also involved in training and developing materials for new student assistants. Most of the training materials that we use now were curated or written by me.</p>

            <p>As an auditorium operator, I operated the camera, audio, and other technical equipment in order to facilitate the efficient running of a large (700+ person) lecture. I also interacted with the professors of the courses in order to understand what they need for the lecture and to deliver information about the auditorium if it is needed. This is another position in which customer service skills are essential as most of my interactions with the professors occur when there are technical difficulties. It was in this capacity that I sat in on the Data 8 lectures in Spring 2018 and discovered my interest in the field, which sparked the desire to change my Applied Maths focus to the subject.</p>

            <p>As a cast member at Regal, I developed most of my customer service skills by interacting with many guests (the average attendance on the weekends was 3,500 guests per day). I assisted guests with purchases, directions, and other issues; in fact, I dealt with many power outage issues, including handling guest service (refunds, swaps, etc.) and bringing projection back online after a blackout. During my time at Regal, I took on many responsibilities outside the scope of my job description, routinely handling projects that I volunteered for in order to learn ore about operations; I even learned how to operate projection, normally a function of management. Lastly, I was the person most frequently called upon to train new hires.</p>
