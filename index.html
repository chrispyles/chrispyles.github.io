            <p>At IXL, I was a member of the Teacher Experience team, which works on maintaining and building new features for educators on IXL's platform. My role involved full-stack development in Struts and React, working on an Agile team with biweekly standups and releases. Within my first six months at IXL, I had already led a full-scale project to allow instructors to pin skill plans for specific classes instead of their entire roster, for which I designed the back-end, wrote a detailed design doc, and led the team through implementation. One of the other big projects I worked on at IXL was a complete refactor of the back-end for personalized skill plans for exams like the SAT, ACT, and NWEA MAP, a feature used by more than 250,000 users. For this project, I designed the new back-end and did most of the implementation. </p>

            <p>At Microsoft, I architected and engineered an open source Python auto-assessment solution called <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/pybryt" target="_blank">PyBryt</a> that implements a unique autograding structure grounded in the philosophy that intermediate to advanced programming courses should not require students to follow a rigid scaffold for solving problems. I provided engineering support to a series of pilots of PyBryt in courses of up to 1,200 students per semester at UC Berkeley, Imperial College London, and Tel Aviv University, and developed and designed software on an Agile team with biweekly standup schedule emphasizing short feedback cycles and iterative development with weekly internal releases. I spent most of the first half of my time at Microsoft working on the initial release of and developing new features for PyBryt.</p>

            <p>In the latter half of my time at Microsoft, I shifted focus to work more on furthering the adoption of PyBryt beyond its pilots at UC Berkeley, Imperial College London, and Tel Aviv University (while still working on feature development). I created a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/pybryt-action" target="_;blank">GitHub Action</a> to automate the use of PyBryt as a continuous integration tool for student repositories; I then used this Action to orchestrate a full-scale implementation of a real-world grading pipeline using GitHub Classroom for collecting different implementations of algorithms to be used to construct exercises for interactive Microsoft Learn modules. I also authored <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/educator-developer-blog/pybryt-for-pedagogical-auto-assessment/ba-p/3263659" target="_blank">a blog post</a> and two Microsoft Learn modules on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/introduction-pybryt/" target="_blank">an introduction to</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/advanced-pybryt/" target="_blank">advanced uses of</a> PyBryt geared towards academics looking to adopt the solution.</p>

            <p>As a part of my internship, I perform inspection and analysis on data from various bank financial reports utilized for analysis of economic activity by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, including detecting and writing remarks for anomalous data points and assessing trends and issues by comparing against past financial data. This involves using internal databases to assess financial data reported to the Statistics function, managing data pipelines from various data sources in order to query, merge, shape, filter, and transform data to meet business needs, and applying cleaned data to business problems by creating data products that utilize the data and algorithms to reduce the workload of analysts.</p>

            <p>I built a remark prediction algorithm (a two-part program) to accompany anomaly detection performed on weekly balance sheet data from the FR 2644 for 65+ depository institutions. The first part pulls 52 weeks of historical data for the report from the current as-of date and merges the data queried from 4 tables into a usable form for predicting remarks and the second matches detected anomalies with the most recent viable remark to carry forward in order to auto-fill the remark for analyst.</p>

            <p>I lead a team of 8 developers working on 3 concurrent open source projects often using previously-unfamiliar technologies using Agile methodologies (include behavior- and test-driven development and continuous integration) to organize development cycles and encourage parallelization of tasks, including performing code review and facilitating weekly meeting standups.</p>

            <p>The main project I work on is an open source Python and R autograding solution, <a href="https://github.com/ucbds-infra/otter-grader" target="_blank">Otter-Grader</a>, that scalably grades students’ programming assignments and abstracts away autograding internals for instructors, which has been adopted in 15+ courses at and outside of UC Berkeley and has impacted 2,500+ students. Part of this work has been creating an open source community for development around GitHub and a public Slack to allow instructors and contributors to communicate effectively and to allow iterations on the package to be a community effort. I also led an interactive hands-on demonstration of autograding solutions and a presentation on the engineering and infrastructure constraints of those solutions at the <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/resources/data-science-education-resources/2020-national-workshop-data-science-education" target="_blank">2020 National Workshop on Data Science Education</a>.</p>

            <p>Another of the projects I led was the end-to-end development and deployment of a Django web application for the <a href="https://github.com/DS-Discovery/DS-Exchange" target="_blank">Data Science Discovery program</a>, allowing students to apply to various projects run a data science research program on campus and hosted on Microsoft Azure. I created an open source GitHub workflow following engineering best practices for collaboration including branch-per-feature, CI/CD pipelines, and multiple staging environments. I also wrote comprehensive internal documentation for the application deployment pipeline as well as how to use and develop on the application following the dev practices set out for this project.</p>

            <h5 id="teaching-data-100" class="anchor"><a href="https://ds100.org/sp21" target="_blank">Data 100: Principles & Techniques of Data Science</a></h5>

            <p><strong>Spring 2021, Fall 2020, Spring 2020.</strong> Since January 2020, I have been a UGSI for Data 100: Principles & Techniques of Data Science, a class of approximately 1200 students. My role includes leading a discussion and lab section comprised of about 30 students each, developing teaching materials for these sections, and holding office hours for studens in the course. My main responsibility for the course covers the course infrastrucutre, including managing the autograder (Otter-Grader, referenced above) and cloud computing environment that students use to complete their assignments.</p>

            <h4 id="teaching-ds-curriculum" class="anchor">Data Science Curriculum Development, UC Berkeley Data Science Education Program</h4>

            <p>As a part of my time at DSEP, I participated in curriculum development for some courses that are taught by DSEP staff and for other "data-enabled" courses (courses outside the Division but which use DSEP infrastructure). The first course that I worked on, L&S 88, focused on reproducibility and open science. It was a connector course for Data 8 (the foundational course for data science students) and it was my role as a connector assistant that spurred me into working more and more in the campus data science community.</p>

            <p>I present here some of the materials that I developed for courses at UC Berkeley as a part of the work I did at the Division, as well as some details on the courses they are for and my role therein. Most of what I present here is work relating to curriculum development, but I also worked as something of a lab assistant on courses, including L&S 88.</p>

            <h5><a href="https://data-88e.github.io/sp21" target="_blank">Data 88E: Economic Models</a></h4>

            <p><strong>Spring 2021, Fall 2020, Spring 2020, Fall 2019.</strong> This course is another Data 8 connector course that looks at how to apply the methods and tools of data science to economic questions. Lecture topics include SymPy, supply & demand, utility, the Cobb-Douglas production function, inequality, game theory, and other applied topics. I am a connector assistant for this class, and my contribution was the game theory lecture along with some <code>ipywidgets</code>-backed applets for use in other notebooks.</p>

            <h5><a href="https://github.com/ds-modules/SW-282" target="_blank">SW 282: Social Welfare Research</a></h5>

            <p><strong>Fall 2019.</strong> This is a <em>module</em> (a set of notebooks presented in non-DS courses) that I am building from scratch. It brings the power of data science to students who have no coding experience so that they can leverage the tools we show them to use in research. It covers subjects including data abstractions for rectangular data, creating data visualizations, and estimating population parameters using the boostrap.</p>

            <h5><a href="https://github.com/ds-modules/MCB-32" target="_blank">MCB 32: Introduction to Human Physiology</a></h5>

            <p><strong>Summer 2019.</strong> This module brings several physiological concepts into the data science framework. My role on this module as mainly in upkeep and updating the notebook styles and code, but I also worked on Lab 9, which deals with building a k-nearest neighbors classifier for diabetes, by adding a section in which we explain hypothesis testing and run an A/B test on the data used in the notebook.</p>

            <h5><a href="https://github.com/chrispyles/uc-berkeley/tree/master/ls88-sp19" target="_blank">L&S 88: Reproducibility and Open Science</a></h4>

            <p><strong>Spring 2019.</strong> This course was a Data 8 connector course that focused on questions of reproducibility and open science within the Data Science community. It featured lectures on things like Project Jupyter, Licensing, and Data Repositories & Archiving. My role in this class was as a connector assistant, which primarily involved curriculum development and lab assisting in class. I developed quite a few labs for this course, including a <code>matplotlib</code> tutorial and a lab on Python vs. R in Jupyter notebooks.</p>
