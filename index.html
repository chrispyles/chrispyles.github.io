			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I am currently in my second year at UC Berkeley, pursuing an Applied Maths BA with a focus in Data Science. I am an Eagle Scout, and the dedication that allowed me to achieve that rank has also allowed for me to work hard enough in high school that I will graduate college in only 3 years. For a long time, I did not have the foggiest idea of what I wanted to do after college, but then I found data science, the niche that falls at between my love of mathematics and my (relatively new) interest in computing. I also love that data science is so widely applicable that I can go into any field that interests me and be able to do impactful work. Besides my interest in maths and computing, I also love to teach. I tutored students in high school in all subjects, and I hope to be able to continue that here at UC Berkeley; one of my ambitions while here is to become a uGSI for maths courses. At the end of the day, I would like to be in a position where I can work with data and teach other to do the same.</p>

				<br>
				
				<p>I worked at ETS during the Spring 2018 semester, operating the booth in the back of one of the large lecture halls (which mainly involved projection, sound, lighting, and camera work). As a part of this, I would listen to lectures for classes without actually being enrolled in them. One of the classes I worked during, Data 8, sparked my interest and led to my taking the class during the subsequent summer term.</p>

				<p>Summer 2018: This course, whose full name is "Foundations of Data Science", is the first data science course students take at UC Berkeley. It covers the basics of Python, statistical models, hypothesis testing, A/B testing, p-values, and classification, among other things. More information on this course can be found at <a href="https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/stat/" target="_blank">https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/stat/</a> under the <strong>STAT C8</strong> heading.</p>

				<br>

				<p>Fall 2018: This course is a connector to Data 8, and I took it in order to suplement the information that is normally taught in CS 61A (this is the first computer science course most UC Berkeley students take; Data 8 + CS 88 = CS 61A). More information on this course can be found at <a href="https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/compsci/" target="_blank">https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/compsci/</a> under the <strong>COMPSCI 88</strong> heading.</p>
