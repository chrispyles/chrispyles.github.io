			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I am an Eagle Scout and currently in my second year at UC Berkeley, majoring in Applied Mathematics with a focus in Data Science and intending to minor in Poltical Economy. I want to go into something finance- or data-related, but I’ve always enjoyed maths and I want to do something where I get to work with that on a daily basis. I have recently experienced an intense interest in coding, learning HTML and CSS in order to build this website along with other languages like Python and R, and I would like to incorporate this newfound interest into my career. Because of my dedication to my high school coursework, I will likely graduate in only 3 years, ending with a BA in Spring 2020. After this point, I’m unsure of where I would like to go. One part of me would love to have the chance to continue school in the form of graduate coursework, but another wants to go straight into a career with my newfound knowledge of data science and financial systems. </p>

				<br>
				
				<p>I worked at ETS during the Spring 2018 semester, operating the booth in the back of one of the large lecture halls (which mainly involved projection, sound, lighting, and camera work). As a part of this, I would listen to lectures for classes without actually being enrolled in them. One of the classes I worked during, Data 8, sparked my interest and led to my taking the class during the subsequent summer term.</p>

				<p>Summer 2018: This course, whose full name is "Foundations of Data Science", is the first data science course students take at UC Berkeley. It covers the basics of Python, statistical models, hypothesis testing, A/B testing, p-values, and classification, among other things. More information on this course can be found at <a href="https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/stat/" target="_blank">https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/stat/</a> under the <strong>STAT C8</strong> heading.</p>

				<h2 class="align-center">CS 88</h2>

				<br>

				<p>Fall 2018: This course is a connector to Data 8, and I took it in order to suplement the information that is normally taught in CS 61A (this is the first computer science course most UC Berkeley students take; Data 8 + CS 88 = CS 61A). More information on this course can be found at <a href="https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/compsci/" target="_blank">https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/compsci/</a> under the <strong>COMPSCI 88</strong> heading.</p>
