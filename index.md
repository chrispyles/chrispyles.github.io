### About Me
I am currently in my second year at UC Berkeley, and I am intending to major in Applied Mathematics with a focus in Data Science. I want to go into something finance- or data-related, but I've always enjoyed maths and I want to do something where I get to work with that on a daily basis. Because of my dedication to my high school coursework, I will likely graduate in only 5 semester, ending with a BA in December 2019. After this point, I'm unsure of where I would like to go. One part of me would love to have the chance to continue school in the form of graduate coursework, but another wants to go straight into a career with my newfound knowledge of data science and financial systems.

## Education

### University of California, Berkeley

I am currently attending UC Berkeley to earn my BA in Applied Maths, with an anticipated graduation of December 2019 and a cumulative GPA of 3.62. While studying, I am trying to also take classes that are relevant to my interest in financial systems and the economy, while also working on-campus and being active in extra-curriculars.

| Freshman | Sophomore | Junior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *Fall 2018*: Multivariable Calculus, General Chemistry & Quantitative Analysis | *Fall 2019*: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (CS 61A), Linear Algebra, Intro to Analysis, Contemporary Theories of Political Economy |  |
| *Spring 2018*: Linear Algebra & Differential Equations |  |  |
| *Summer 2018*: Foundations of Data Science (Data 8), Discrete Math |  |  |

#### Work Samples
In the course of my work while taking Introduction to Culture and Natural Resource Management with Dr. Kurt Spreyer, I participated in Dr. Spreyer's research involving the development of the East Bay shoreline. As a part of this project, I used UC Berkeley's `datascience` module of Python to do various analyses of the demographic changes of the East Bay. My work is published on the site we created, which can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/espm50-spreyer/demography).

In my own free time, I used what I learned between sitting in on Data 8 lectures during my work at ETS and some studying I did for CS 61A to write a python function that takes in a table with a filled in sudoku puzzle and determines whether or not the puzzle is solved correctly. Here is the program:

```
from datascience import *
import numpy as np
np.set_printoptions(threshold=np.inf)

def check_sudoku(sudoku_table):
    ''' Takes a 9x9 table (not including column title row) of sudoku 
    solutions and determines whether or not they meet the rules of sudoku'''
    collection_array = make_array()
    for i in np.arange(1, 10, 1):
        for j in np.arange(9):
            num_occurances = np.count_nonzero(sudoku_table.column(j) == i)
            if num_occurances == 1:
                collection_array = np.append(collection_array, 1)
            else:
                print("Sorry, but your answers don't work.")
                print(collection_array)
                return len(collection_array)
    for i in np.arange(1, 10, 1):
        for j in np.arange(9):
            num_occurances = np.count_nonzero(sudoku_table.row(j) == i)
            if num_occurances == 1:
                collection_array = np.append(collection_array, 1)
            else:
                print("Sorry, but your answers don't work.")
                print(collection_array)
                return len(collection_array)
    if np.sum(collection_array) == 162:
        print('Congratulations! Your sudoku answers check out!')
        return collection_array
    else:
        print("Sorry, but your answers don't work.")
        return collection_array
```

The first few lines of code import the UC Berkeley `datascience` module and the module NumPy to work with arrays. The function prints a line that tells you whether or not your table is a solution, but it also returns the array `collection_array`, which I used while writing the program in order to determine where the faults lay in the iterations (the `for` loops).

### Santa Susana High School

I graduated from SSHS in June 2017 with a cumulative GPA of 4.38. While at SSHS, I mainly focused on my interest in the hard sciences, like chemistry, and a fondness for anatomy that fostered from growing up with a mother who was a nurse. In the 12th grade, I took an Anatomy & Physiology course wherein our final project was to write a dissection manual for the dissection of a rabbit's respiratory system; you can view the finished product [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7kiIqQskeaWZkluR2xhTTBqX28/preview).

I also completed a a Senior Project (what we termed out capstone projects), which involved publishing an issue of our literary magazine, [*Litt√©rateur*](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7kiIqQskeaWdXU4RUg3bDhXSDQ/preview). The issue for which I was Editor-In-Chief focused on the US education system and its benefits and pitfalls. The publishing of this magazine I consider to be one of my greatest achievements, among such others as attaining the rank of Eagle Scout.
