### About Me
I am currently in my second year at UC Berkeley, and I am intending to major in Applied Mathematics with a focus in Data Science. I want to go into something finance- or data-related, but I've always enjoyed maths and I want to do something where I get to work with that on a daily basis. Because of my dedication to my high school coursework, I will likely graduate in only 5 semester, ending with a BA in December 2019. After this point, I'm unsure of where I would like to go. One part of me would love to have the chance to continue school in the form of graduate coursework, but another wants to go straight into a career with my newfound knowledge of data science and financial systems.
