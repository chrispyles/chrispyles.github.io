# Education

## University of California, Berkeley
_Major in Applied Mathematics with a Focus in Data Science_
I am currently attending UC Berkeley to earn my BA in Applied Maths, with an anticipated graduation of Spring 2020 and a cumulative GPA of 3.50. I am also trying to take classes that are relevant to my interest in financial systems and computer science, while working on campus and being active in extra-curriculars. When I came to UC Berkeley, I had intended to major in Chemical Biology; that quickly changed, however, as I realized just how much math interested me and I had the opportunity to begin learning data science.

### Work Samples
One of the projects that I work on outside of class, to sharpen my programming skills, is to program games in Python that are designed to be played through the terminal. As an exsample, I took what I learned in my Python classes to develop a terminal version of Jeopardy. To play it, you can fork the repository or clone it locally, and then cd into the directory and run this from your terminal:

```bash
$ python play.py
Please enter the game number.

While taking my corporate finance class in Fall 2018, I began to write some Python code to help with completing the work that is covered in that class (e.g. arbitrage opportunities, annuities, perpetuities, stock and options pricing). The programs utilize Python classes to represent problems, taking in the requisite data and returning the desired parameter. The repository is still a work-in-progress, but you can see what I have already done [on Github](https://github.com/chrispyles/engineering-120).

In the course of my work while taking Introduction to Culture and Natural Resource Management with Dr. Kurt Spreyer, I participated in Dr. Spreyer’s research involving the development of the East Bay shoreline. As a part of this project, I used UC Berkeley’s `datascience` module of Python to do various analyses of the demographic changes of the East Bay. My work is published on the site we created, which can be [found here](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/espm50-spreyer/demography).

As a part of my summer courses in 2018, while I was learning Python, Java, HTML, and CSS, I also took up the task of learning LaTeX so that I could turn in typed homework for my Discrete Mathematics class (I'm sure more than a few of you can understand the pains of poor penmanship). To showcase my skills at LaTeX, please see [this assignment](files/Math_55_Su18.pdf), which I wrote and submitted using LaTeX. I have since been using LaTeX to turn in the written portions of some of my Stat 140 assignments; for a particularly nice example, please see [this piece](files/Stat_140_Fa18.pdf) of a recent homework assignment that I submitted.
