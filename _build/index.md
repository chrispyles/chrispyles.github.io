# About Me
I am currently in my second year at UC Berkeley, pursuing an Applied Maths BA with a focus in Data Science. I am an Eagle Scout, and the dedication that allowed me to achieve that rank has also allowed me to hold down a job to help put myself through college and to work hard enough in high school that I will graduate college in only 3 years. For a long time, I did not have the foggiest idea of what I wanted to do after college, but then I found data science, the niche that falls between my love of mathematics and my (relatively new) interest in computing. I also love that data science is so widely applicable that I can go into any field that interests me and be able to do impactful work.
