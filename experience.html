			<h2>Student Assistant</h2>
			<p class="subheading">UC Berkeley Summer Sessions, September 2017 - Present</p>

			

			<p>As a student assistant, customer service skills are at the crux of my responsibilities. I interact with all of the students who need assistance from the Student Services team, and so I need to effectively work with others, and be able to help alleviate the concerns of others, give information regarding different aspects of summer courses, and perform basic office tasks. I also have a few different projects; one of my most recent was developing the training materials for other student assistants, which can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xN62_FJRSgoWeFQAdLwBTm-JudzskhV79t3_4P4OQxw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

			<h2>Auditorium Operator</h2>
			<p class="subheading">UC Berkeley Educational Technology Services, January 2018 - May 2018</p>

			

			<p>As an auditorium operator, I operated the camera, audio, and other technical equipment in order to facilitate the effect running of a large (700+ person) lecture. I also interact with the professors of the courses in order to understand what they need for the lecture, and to deliver information about the auditorium if it is needed. This is another position in which customer service skills are essential, since most of my interactions with the professors occur when there are technical difficulties. It was in this capacity that I sat in on the Data 8 lectures in Spring 2018 and discovered my interest in the field, which sparked the desire to change my Applied Maths focus to the subject. It is also how I learned the <code>datascience</code> module before taking Data 8.</p>

			<h2>Cast Member</h2>
			<p class="subheading">Regal Civic Center 16 & IMAX, October 2015 - December 2017</p>

			

			<p>As a cast member at Regal, I developed most of my customer service skills by interacting with many guests (the average attendance on the weekends was 3,500 guests per day). I assisted guests with purchases, directions, and other issues; in fact, I dealt with many power outage issues, including handling guest service (refunds, swaps, etc.) and bringing projection back online after a blackout. During my time at Regal, I took on many responsibilities outside the scope of my job description, routinely handling projects that I volunteered for in order to learn ore about operations; I even learned how to operate projection, normally a function of management!</p>

				<h2 class="align-center">UC Berkeley ETS</h2>

				<br>
				
				<p>I worked at ETS during the Spring 2018 semester, operating the booth in the back of one of the large lecture halls (which mainly involved projection, sound, lighting, and camera work). As a part of this, I would listen to lectures for classes without actually being enrolled in them. One of the classes I worked during, Data 8, sparked my interest and led to my taking the class during the subsequent summer term.</p>

				<br>

				<p>Summer 2018: This course, whose full name is "Foundations of Data Science", is the first data science course students take at UC Berkeley. It covers the basics of Python, statistical models, hypothesis testing, A/B testing, p-values, and classification, among other things. More information on this course can be found at <a href="https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/stat/" target="_blank">https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/stat/</a> under the <strong>STAT C8</strong> heading.</p>

				<br>

				<p>Fall 2018: This course is a connector to Data 8, and I took it in order to suplement the information that is normally taught in CS 61A (this is the first computer science course most UC Berkeley students take; Data 8 + CS 88 = CS 61A). More information on this course can be found at <a href="https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/compsci/" target="_blank">https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/compsci/</a> under the <strong>COMPSCI 88</strong> heading.</p>
