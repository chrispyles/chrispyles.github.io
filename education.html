				<h2 class="title">University of California, Berkeley</h2><p class="subheading title">Major in Applied Mathematics with a Focus in Data Science</p>

				

				<p>I am currently attending UC Berkeley to earn my BA in Applied Maths, with an anticipated graduation of <strong>Spring 2020</strong> and a cumulative GPA of <strong>3.55</strong>. While studying, I am trying to also take classes that are relevant to my interest in financial systems and computer science, while also working on campus and being active in extra-curriculars. When I came to UC Berkeley, I had intended to major in Chemical Biology; that quickly changed, however, as I realized just how much math interested me. And, while watching the Data 8 lectures as a part of my position at ETS, I decided that Data Science should be the focus on my application. </p>

				<h3>Work Samples</h3>

					<p>As quick sample of the kind of work that goes on in UC Berkeley introductory CS classes, here is one of the homework problems I completed in CS 88: it is a function that computes the hailstone sequence of a number <code>n</code> and returns the number of steps in that sequence. A hailstone sequence goes like this:</p>
					<p><indent>While <code>n</code> is not 1:</p>
					<p><indent><indent>1. If <code>n</code> is even, divide it by 2.</p>
					<p><indent><indent>2. If <code>n</code> is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.</p>
					<p><indent><indent>3. Repeat until <code>n</code> is 1.</p>

					<p>Here is the program I wrote to find the hailstone sequence of a number <code>n</code> (note that the code follows the same sequence of actions as the description above; a good strategy to follow when writing a program is to follow explicit, step-by-step instructions until the desired result is achieved):</p>

					<p class="code">
						def hailstone(n): <br>
						<indent>print(n)<br>
							<indent>steps = 1 <br>
						    <indent>while n != 1: <br>
						    	<indent><indent>if n % 2 == 0: <br>
						    		<indent><indent><indent>n = int(n/2) <br>
						    		<indent><indent><indent>print(n) <br>
						    		<indent><indent><indent>steps += 1 <br></indent>
						    	<indent><indent>else: <br>
						    		<indent><indent><indent>n = int(3*n+1) <br>
						    		<indent><indent><indent>print(n) <br>
						    		<indent><indent><indent>steps += 1 <br></indent>
						    <indent>return steps</indent>
					</p>

					<br>

					<p>If you run <code>hailstone(10)</code>, you would get this output:</p>

					<p class="code">
						>>> a = hailstone(10) <br>
						10<br>
						5<br>
						16<br>
						8<br>
						4<br>
						2<br>
						1<br>
						>>> a<br>
						7
					</p>

					<p>In the course of my work while taking Introduction to Culture and Natural Resource Management with Dr. Kurt Spreyer, I participated in Dr. Spreyer’s research involving the development of the East Bay shoreline. As a part of this project, I used UC Berkeley’s <code>datascience</code> module of Python to do various analyses of the demographic changes of the East Bay. My work is published on the site we created, which can be found <a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/espm50-spreyer/demography" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
					<br>
					<p>When I took Data 8 during the summer of 2018, I was did lots of work using data sets in conjunction with the tools that I learned in the class. One sample of my work, the final project for the class focusing on classifiers (specifically <span class="eqn">k</span>-nearest neighbors classifiers), can be fond in <a href="./files/Data_8_Su18.zip" target="_blank"> this zip file</a>. I also have a sample of my writing from when I took The Classic Myths in the spring of 2018. <a href="./files/Classics_28_Sp18.pdf" target="_blank">This essay </a> is a comparison between classic tropes in Greek mythology, specificaly the <em>Odyssey</em>, and a Coen Bros. film, <em>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</em></p>
					<br>
					<p>As a part of my summer courses in 2018, while I was learning Python, Java, HTML, and CSS, I also took up the task of learning LaTeX so that I could turn in typed homework for my Discrete Mathematics class (I'm sure more than a few of you can understand the pains of poor penmanship). To showcase my skills at LaTeX, please see <a href="./files/Math_55_Su18.pdf" target="_blank">this assignment</a>, which I wrote and submitted using LaTeX. I have since been using LaTeX to turn in the written portions of some of my Stat 140 assignments; for a particularly nice example, please see <a href="./files/Stat_140_Fa18.pdf" target="_blank">this piece</a> of a recent homework assignment that I submitted.</p>

					<p>In my own free time, I used what I learned between sitting in on Data 8 lectures during my work at <a href="#ETSmodal">ETS</a> and some studying I did for CS 88 to write a Python function that takes in a table with a filled in sudoku puzzle and determines whether or not the puzzle is solved correctly. Here is the program:</p>




					<br>

					<div id="sudoku-program">
						<p class="code">from datascience import * <br>

								    <indent> ''' Takes a 9x9 table (not including column title row) of sudoku </indent> <br>
								    <indent> solutions and determines whether or not they meet the rules of sudoku''' </indent><br>
								    <indent> collection_array = make_array() </indent><br>
								    <indent> for i in np.arange(1, 10, 1): </indent><br>
								        <indent> <indent> for j in np.arange(9): </indent></indent><br>
								            <indent> <indent><indent>num_occurances = np.count_nonzero(sudoku_table.column(j) == i) </indent></indent></indent><br>

								                <indent> <indent> <indent><indent>return len(collection_array) </indent> </indent></indent></indent><br>
								    <indent> for i in np.arange(1, 10, 1): </indent><br>

								            <indent> <indent> <indent> num_occurances = np.count_nonzero(sudoku_table.row(j) == i) </indent></indent></indent><br>
								            <indent> <indent> <indent> if num_occurances == 1: </indent></indent></indent><br>
								                <indent> <indent> <indent> <indent> collection_array = np.append(collection_array, 1) </indent></indent></indent></indent><br>
								            <indent> <indent> <indent> else: </indent></indent></indent><br>
								                <indent> <indent> <indent> <indent> print("Sorry, but your answers don't work.") </indent></indent></indent></indent><br>
								                <indent> <indent> <indent> <indent> print(collection_array) </indent></indent></indent></indent><br>
								                <indent> <indent> <indent> <indent> return len(collection_array) </indent></indent></indent></indent><br>
								    <indent> if np.sum(collection_array) == 162: </indent><br>
								        <indent> <indent> print('Congratulations! Your sudoku answers check out!') </indent></indent><br>
								        <indent> <indent> return collection_array </indent></indent><br>
								    <indent> else: </indent><br>
								        <indent> <indent> print("Sorry, but your answers don't work.") </indent></indent><br>
								        <indent> <indent> return collection_array </indent></indent></p>
					</div>

					<br>

					<p>The first few lines of code import the UC Berkeley <code>datascience</code> module and the module NumPy to work with arrays. The function prints a line that tells you whether or not your table is a solution, but it also returns the array <code>collection_array</code>, which I used while writing the program in order to determine where the faults lay in the iterations (the <code>for</code> loops).</p>

				<h2>Santa Susana High School</h2>

				

				<p>I graduated from SSHS in June 2017 with a cumulative GPA of 4.38. While at SSHS, I mainly focused on my interest in the hard sciences, like chemistry, and a fondness for anatomy that fostered from growing up with a mother who was a nurse. In the 12th grade, I took an Anatomy & Physiology course wherein our final project was to write a dissection manual for the dissection of a rabbit’s respiratory system; you can view the finished product below.</p>

				<br>

				<p>I also completed a capstone project at SSHS, which was the publication of our literary magazine, <em>Litérateur</em>. This issue I headed was focued on Education & Education Reform, and contained works ranging student experiences in the education system to explanations of statistical predictions and recommendations for action. The issue, seen below, was a great success, and helped nurture the interest that I have in journalism and publication today.</p>

				<p>I worked at ETS during the Spring 2018 semester, operating the booth in the back of one of the large lecture halls (which mainly involved projection, sound, lighting, and camera work). As a part of this, I would listen to lectures for classes without actually being enrolled in them. One of the classes I worked during, Data 8, sparked my interest and led to my taking the class during the subsequent summer term.</p>
