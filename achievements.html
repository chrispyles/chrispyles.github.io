			<h2>Eagle Scout</h2>

			<div class="float">
			

			<p class="float">As of October 19, 2016, I am an Eagle Scout. The highest award in the Boy Scouts of America, I worked my way up through seven ranks and twenty-something merit badges before completing an Eagle Scout Service Project in order to obtain this honor. The Eagle Project involved designing, funding, and completing a project to benefit a local nonprofit; my project involved repainting ceiling tiles in my high school’s MPR. You can see my project notebook (from proposal to conclusion) <a href="./assets/eagle_project_wb.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

			<h2>Foresight Prep @ Oberlin: Future of Communications</h2>

			

			<p>I attended a seminar in July 2017 on communications at Oberlin College. This seminar was such and interesting experience for me: it was a chance for me to break out of my STEM-oriented coursework and to look into fields with more of a liberal arts focus. While I did decide on pursuing an Applied Maths degree, attending Foresight Prep opened my eyes to lots of different ways of communicating and gave me innumerable skills that I am confident will be a great aid in my professional life after university. Most of the class was focused on college prep and presentation skills, the latter of which I know will come into play. The final project that we completed as a part of the seminar was to develop, in groups of 3, a communications plan for a local nonprofit; my group’s nonprofit was the Oberlin Food Hub. You can see some of the work that I did below, and look at the website mockup we made at <a href="https://comsfoodhub.weebly.com" target="_blank">comsfoodhub.weebly.com</a>.</p>

			<br>

			<p>This is one of the materials that I made for the Oberlin Food Hub as a part of the project. It is a template for a flier that they can use, created using Adobe InDesign in conjunction with Photoshop.</p>

				<h2 class="align-center">UC Berkeley ETS</h2>

				<br>
				
				<p>I worked at ETS during the Spring 2018 semester, operating the booth in the back of one of the large lecture halls (which mainly involved projection, sound, lighting, and camera work). As a part of this, I would listen to lectures for classes without actually being enrolled in them. One of the classes I worked during, Data 8, sparked my interest and led to my taking the class during the subsequent summer term.</p>

				<p>Summer 2018: This course, whose full name is "Foundations of Data Science", is the first data science course students take at UC Berkeley. It covers the basics of Python, statistical models, hypothesis testing, A/B testing, p-values, and classification, among other things. More information on this course can be found at <a href="https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/stat/" target="_blank">https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/stat/</a> under the <strong>STAT C8</strong> heading.</p>

				<h2 class="align-center">CS 88</h2>

				<br>

				<p>Fall 2018: This course is a connector to Data 8, and I took it in order to suplement the information that is normally taught in CS 61A (this is the first computer science course most UC Berkeley students take; Data 8 + CS 88 = CS 61A). More information on this course can be found at <a href="https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/compsci/" target="_blank">https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/compsci/</a> under the <strong>COMPSCI 88</strong> heading.</p>
