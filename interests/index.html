<h3>Coding</h3>



<p>Languages: Python, Julia, R, Command Line| Currently Learning: Java</p>



<p>While watching the Data 8 lectures as a part of my position at ETS, I became intrigued by the prospect of data science; I thought that it was amazing how powerful computations could be processed in seconds and how the analysis of large data sets could be performed so quickly. It was in watching these lectures and doing some experiments with the <g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="5" data-gr-id="5"><code>datascience</code></g> library in my free time that I became enamored with the prospect of learning to code beyond the data-specific aspects of Python libraries. I decided to enroll in Data 8 for Summer 2018 so that I could get credit for the practice I put in while watching the lectures, and then I moved to CS 88.</p>



<p>I have toyed around with Python in quite a few experiments, most notably in making text-based games like Jeopardy, Hangman, and Wheel of Fortune. The code for these games is available <a href="https://github.com/chrispyles/python-games">on Github</a>.</p>



<p>You can see some featured coding and data science projects on my <a href="http://portfolio.cpyles.com">portfolio site</a>.</p>



<h3>Web Design</h3>



<p>In the summer when I was learning about Github and data science, I also decided to take up the task of making myself a personal website. To this end, I learned HTML, CSS, and Sass on Codecademy so that I could write static HTML and make my own website, which I hosted (and still do) on Github Pages. </p>



<p>I later decided to take up learning WordPress so that I could broaden my web design horizons. I am currently the CTO and web designer for a student-run non-profit, Partners Through Education, whose <a href="http://partnersthrougheducation.org">website</a> is run on WordPress and hosted on Github.</p>



<p>While my current website is built using WordPress, web design has remained an interest of mine and I do still write some HTML websites for other projects.</p>



<h3>Finance and the Economy</h3>



<p>This interest began when I took AP Macroeconomics in high school, and it has grown since. I was fascinated by how different sectors of the economy were so interconnected with each other, and how a small cause somewhere inevitably led to a large effect in a completely different place. Since AP Macro, my interest has grown more specifically into finance; last semester, I took Engineering 120, a class on economics and finance, and I hope to get more involved in UC Berkeley’s finance community.</p>
