<p>I am currently in my second year at UC Berkeley, pursuing a Data Science BA. Since tutoring for my high school CSF chapter, I have had a passion for teaching others, which has blossomed into taking a position on campus at the budding Division of Data Sciences. I started as a connector assistant (think lab assistant + curriculum development), and am now working on the External Pedagogy Team which interfaces with other institutions about how we teach data science. I am an Eagle Scout, and the dedication that allowed me to achieve that rank has also allowed me to hold down a job to help put myself through college and to work hard enough in high school that I will graduate college in only 3 years.</p>



<div id="education"></div>



<h2>Education</h2>



<h3>University of California, Berkeley</h3>



<p><em>Class of 2020, Majoring in Data Science, Minoring in Demography</em></p>



<p>I am currently attending UC Berkeley to earn my BA in Data Science, with an anticipated graduation of <strong>Spring 2020</strong>. I am also trying to take classes that are relevant to my interest in financial systems and computer science while working on campus and being active in extra-curriculars. When I came to UC Berkeley, I had intended to major in Chemical Biology; that quickly changed, however, as I realized just how much math interested me and I had the opportunity to begin learning data science.</p>



<h4>Work Samples</h4>



<p>One of the projects that I work on outside of class, to sharpen my programming skills, is to program games in Python that are designed to be played through the terminal. As an example, I took what I learned in my Python classes to develop a terminal version of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/chrispyles/python-games/tree/master/jeopardy" target="_blank">Jeopardy</a>. To play it, you can fork the repository or clone it locally, and then <code>cd</code> into the directory and run this from your terminal:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ python play.py
Please enter the game number.

</code></pre>



<p>While taking my corporate finance class in Fall 2018, I began to write some Python code to help with completing the work that is covered in that class (e.g. arbitrage opportunities, annuities, perpetuities, stock and options pricing). The programs utilize Python classes to represent problems, taking in the requisite data and returning the desired parameter. The repository is still a work-in-progress, but you can see what I have already done <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/chrispyles/engineering-120" target="_blank">on Github</a>.</p>



<div id="interests"></div>



<h2>Interests</h2>



<h3>Coding</h3>



<p>Languages: Python, Julia, R, Command Line | Currently Learning: Java</p>



<p>While watching the Data 8 lectures as a part of my position at ETS, I became intrigued by the prospect of data science; I thought that it was amazing how powerful computations could be processed in seconds and how the analysis of large data sets could be performed so quickly. It was in watching these lectures and doing some experiments with the <code>datascience</code> library in my free time that I became enamored with the prospect of learning to code beyond the data-specific aspects of Python libraries. I decided to enroll in Data 8 for Summer 2018 so that I could get credit for the practice I put in while watching the lectures, and then I moved to CS 88.</p>



<p>I have toyed around with Python in quite a few experiments, most notably in making text-based games like Jeopardy, Hangman, and Wheel of Fortune. The code for these games is available <a href="https://github.com/chrispyles/python-games">on Github</a>.</p>



<p>You can see some featured coding and data science projects on my <a href="http://portfolio.cpyles.com/">portfolio site</a>.</p>



<h3>Web Design</h3>



<p>In the summer when I was learning about Github and data science, I also decided to take up the task of making myself a personal website. To this end, I learned HTML, CSS, and Sass on Codecademy so that I could write static HTML and make my own website, which I hosted (and still do) on Github Pages.</p>



<p>I later decided to take up learning WordPress so that I could broaden my web design horizons. I am currently the CTO and web designer for a student-run non-profit, Partners Through Education, whose <a href="http://partnersthrougheducation.org/">website</a> is run on WordPress and hosted on Github.</p>



<p>While my current website is built using WordPress, web design has remained an interest of mine and I do still write some HTML websites for other projects.</p>



<h3>Finance and the Economy</h3>



<p>This interest began when I took AP Macroeconomics in high school, and it has grown since. I was fascinated by how different sectors of the economy were so interconnected with each other, and how a small cause somewhere inevitably led to a large effect in a completely different place. Since AP Macro, my interest has grown more specifically into finance; last semester, I took Engineering 120, a class on economics and finance, and I hope to get more involved in UC Berkeley’s finance community.</p>



<div id="coursedev"></div>



<h2>Course Development</h2>



<h3>Data Science Curriculum Development, UC Berkeley</h3>



<p>As a part of my time at the Division of Data Sciences at UC Berkeley, I participated in curriculum development for some courses that are taught by Division staff and for other “data-enabled” courses (courses outside the Division but which use Division infrastructure). The first course that I worked on, L&S 88, focused on reproducibility and open science. It was a connector course for Data 8 (the foundational course for data science students) and it was my role as a connector assistant that spurred me into working more and more at the Division.</p>



<p>I present here some of the materials that I developed for courses at UC Berkeley as a part of the work I did at the Division, as well as some details on the courses they are for and my role therein. Most of what I present here is work relating to curriculum development, but I also worked as something of a lab assistant on courses, including L&S 88.</p>



<h4><a href="https://github.com/chrispyles/uc-berkeley/tree/master/ls88-sp19">L&S 88: Reproducibility and Open Science</a></h4>



<p><strong>Spring 2019.</strong> This course was a Data 8 connector course that focused on questions of reproducibility and open science within the Data Science community. It featured lectures on things like Project Jupyter, Licensing, and Data Repositories & Archiving. My role in this class was as a connector assistant, which primarily involved curriculum development and lab assisting in class. I developed quite a few labs for this course, including a <code>matplotlib</code> tutorial and a lab on Python vs. R in Jupyter notebooks</p>



<h4>Data 88: Economic Models</h4>



<p><strong>Fall 2019.</strong> This course is another Data 8 connector course that looks at how to apply the methods and tools of data science to economic questions. Lecture topics include SymPy, supply & demand, utility, the Cobb-Douglas production function, inequality, and other applied topics. I am a connector assistant for this class also, and my contribution was the economic demography lecture along with bits dispersed among the other notebooks.</p>

<h2>Co-Curriculars</h2>



<h3>Connector Assistant</h3>



<p><em>Division of Data Sciences, UC Berkeley</em></p>



<p>I started at DDS in January 2019 as a connector assistant for L&S 88: Reproducibility & Open Science. This class teaches data science students about the culture in data science and the importance of reproducibility in results. The class covers technical topics ranging from Jupyter Notebooks to Markdown & LaTeX to Git. As connector assistant, my role was twofold: I attended class and acted as a lab assistant during the lab portion of the class, and I worked with the course instructors (Eric Van Dusen & Joshua Quan) to develop assignments that fit with the narrative they had for the course. The materials that I worked on for this course can be found on the <a href="https://cpyles.com/course-development/">Course Development page</a> of this website.</p>



<h3>CTO & Web Designer</h3>



<p><em>Partners Through Education</em></p>



<p><a href="http://partnersthrougheducation.org/">Partners Through Education</a> is a student-run non-profit that aims to provide scholarships and college admissions resources for students in the LA area. I was given the opportunity to work with them as their CTO and web designer. I run their website (linked above) which uses WordPress infrastructure and is hosted as a static HTML site on Github.</p>



<h3>Eagle Scout</h3>



<p>As of October 19, 2016, I am an Eagle Scout. The highest award in the Boy Scouts of America, I worked my way up through seven ranks and twenty-something merit badges before completing an Eagle Scout Service Project in order to obtain this honor. The Eagle Project involved designing, funding, and completing a project to benefit a local nonprofit; my project involved repainting ceiling tiles in my high school’s MPR. You can see my project notebook (from proposal to conclusion) <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cpyles.com/assets/eagle_project_wb.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>I attended a seminar in July 2017 on communications at Oberlin College. This seminar was such and interesting experience for me: it was a chance for me to break out of my STEM-oriented coursework and to look into fields with more of a liberal arts focus. While I did decide on pursuing an Applied Maths degree, attending Foresight Prep opened my eyes to lots of different ways of communicating and gave me innumerable skills that I am confident will be a great aid in my professional life after university. Most of the class was focused on college prep and presentation skills, the latter of which I know will come into play. The final project that we completed as a part of the seminar was to develop, in groups of 3, a communications plan for a local nonprofit; my group’s nonprofit was the Oberlin Food Hub. You can see some of the work that I did below, and look at the website mockup we made at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://comsfoodhub.weebly.com/" target="_blank">comsfoodhub.weebly.com</a>.</p>



<p>This is one of the materials that I made for the Oberlin Food Hub as a part of the project. It is a template for a flier that they can use, created using Adobe InDesign in conjunction with Photoshop.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cpyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/food_hub_flier-791x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21" srcset="https://cpyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/food_hub_flier-791x1024.png 791w,https://cpyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/food_hub_flier-232x300.png 232w,https://cpyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/food_hub_flier-768x994.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px"></figure><div id="experience"></div>



<h2>Work Experience</h2>



<h3>External Pedagogy Intern</h3>



<p><em>UC Berkeley Division of Data Sciences, May 2019 – Present</em></p>



<p>My internship at the division is a kind of hodgepodge of different responsibilities and projects. The position is focused around the External Pedagogy Team which interacts with other institutions to think about how we teach data science and grow the community since it is such an emergent field in higher learning. Because of my other connections at the division, however, I am also doing lots of other work, including working on another connector course, working on the website, and helping to put together a textbook of <a href="https://ds-modules.github.io/modules-textbook">featured modules</a> using Jupyter Books.</p>



<h3>Student Assistant</h3>



<p><em>UC Berkeley Summer Sessions, September 2017 – Present</em></p>



<p>As a student assistant, customer service skills are at the crux of my responsibilities. I interact with all of the students who need assistance from the Student Services team, and so I need to effectively work with others, and be able to help alleviate the concerns of others, give information regarding different aspects of summer courses, and perform basic office tasks. I am also involved in training and developing materials for new student assistants. Most of the training materials that we use now were curated or written by me.</p>



<h3>Auditorium Operator</h3>



<p><em>UC Berkeley Educational Technology Services, January 2018 – May 2018</em></p>



<p>As an auditorium operator, I operated the camera, audio, and other technical equipment in order to facilitate the efficient running of a large (700+ person) lecture. I also interacted with the professors of the courses in order to understand what they need for the lecture and to deliver information about the auditorium if it is needed. This is another position in which customer service skills are essential as most of my interactions with the professors occur when there are technical difficulties. It was in this capacity that I sat in on the Data 8 lectures in Spring 2018 and discovered my interest in the field, which sparked the desire to change my Applied Maths focus to the subject.</p>



<h3>Cast Member</h3>



<p><em>Regal Civic Center 16 & IMAX, October 2015 – December 2017</em></p>



<p>As a cast member at Regal, I developed most of my customer service skills by interacting with many guests (the average attendance on the weekends was 3,500 guests per day). I assisted guests with purchases, directions, and other issues; in fact, I dealt with many power outage issues, including handling guest service (refunds, swaps, etc.) and bringing projection back online after a blackout. During my time at Regal, I took on many responsibilities outside the scope of my job description, routinely handling projects that I volunteered for in order to learn ore about operations; I even learned how to operate projection, normally a function of management. Lastly, I was the person most frequently called upon to train new hires.</p>
